## Features

Flatlogic Ecommerce is a great template to quick-start development of SAAS, CMS, IoT Dashboard, E-Commerce apps, etc  
Lite version of a Flatlogic Ecommerce includes following features and pages:

* React Bootstrap
* Responsive layout
* Next JS (SSR)

* Error page
* Styled components like buttons, modals, etc

## Pages
We have implemented some basic pages, so you can see our template in action.

## Instalation 

1. Clone repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/flatlogic/ecommerce-frontend.git
```
2. Get in the project folder
```shell
cd ecommerce-frontend
```
3. Install dependencies via npm or yarn
```shell
yarn
```

## Quick start
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
